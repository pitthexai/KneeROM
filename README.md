## An Android Mobile App to Automatically Measure and Analyze Knee Range of Motion (ROM)
<p align="justify">Knee range of motion (ROM) is an important clinical variable which directly provides information about knee joint functionality. Specifically following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the ability to flex and extend needs to be monitored in the postoperative period and has an impact on patient outcomes and mobility. Outside the clinical setting, patients may not be able to accurately assess knee ROM, which may impair recovery following trauma or surgery. Thus, we built a mobile app that aims to automatically measure knee ROM. </p>
